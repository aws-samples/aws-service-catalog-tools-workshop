## What are we going to do?

This tutorial will walk you through "{{% param title %}}" with a spoke account.

We will assume you have installed Service Catalog Puppet correctly.

During this process you will check your progress by verifying what the framework is doing at each step.

### Verify the portfolio was created

Once you have made your changes the {{% service_catalog_factory_pipeline_link %}} should have run or if you were quick 
may still be running.  If it has not yet started feel free to the hit the *Release change* button.

Once it has completed it should show the *Source* and *Build* stages in green to indicate they have completed

Once you have verified the pipeline has run you can go to {{% service_catalog_portfolios_list_link %}} to view your
portfolio.

You should see the portfolio you just created listed:
