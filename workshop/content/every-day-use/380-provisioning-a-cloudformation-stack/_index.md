## What are we going to do?

This tutorial will walk you through how to use the "{{% param title %}}" feature.

We will assume you have:
 
 - installed Service Catalog Puppet correctly
 - bootstrapped a spoke
 - created a manifest file
 - added an account to the manifest file

We will assume you are comfortable:
 - making changes your manifest file
 
We are going to perform the following steps to "{{% param title %}}":

- upload a template to AWS CloudFormation
- specify an AWS CloudFormation template that should be provisioned


## Step by step guide

Here are the steps you need to follow to "{{% param title %}}"

### Things to note, before we start

- This feature was added to version 0.108.0.  You will need to be using this version (or later)
- Stacks can use parameters, deploy_to and outputs
- Stacks can be used in spoke execution mode
- Stacks can be used in dry-runs
- Stacks do not appear in list-launches (they are not a launch)

### Upload a template to AWS CloudFormation

When you upgrade to version 0.108.0 or newer you will see a bucket named _sc-puppet-stacks-repository-xxx_ where xxx is 
your AWS account id.  You should upload a template into that bucket and get the version id of the template:

### Specify an AWS CloudFormation template that should be provisioned

_Now we are ready to add a stack to the manifest file._

- Navigate to the {{% service_catalog_puppet_code_commit_repo_link %}}

- Click the *ServiceCatalogPuppet* repository

- Click the link to the *manifest.yaml* file, and then click the *Edit* button

- Add the following snippet to the end of the main input field:

 <figure>
  {{< highlight js >}}
stacks:
  basic-vpc:
    key: product.template.yaml
    version_id: 1tPCvNHLEw8fsARqJ2RFouBfebRpURS7
    depends_on:
      - name: basic-vpc
        type: launches
        affinity: account
    deploy_to:
      tags:
        - tag: group:spoke
          regions: regions_enabled
    outputs:
      ssm:
        - stack_output: VPCId
          param_name: "/vpcs/${AWS::AccountId}/${AWS::Region}/VPCId"
  {{< / highlight >}}
 </figure>


### Committing the manifest file

_Now that we have updated the manifest file we are ready to commit our changes._

- Set your *Author name*
- Set your *Email address*
- Set your *Commit message*

{{% notice tip %}}
Using a good / unique commit message will help you understand what is going on later.
{{% /notice %}}


- Click the *Commit changes* button:
