# What is AWS Service Catalog?

AWS Service Catalog Service allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. 

These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete 
multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services, 
and helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly 
deploy only the approved IT services they need.


> NOTE: Whilst this Workshop makes use of AWS Service Catalog, the primary goal is to learn how to use a suite of open source tools created to compliment the native AWS service.
