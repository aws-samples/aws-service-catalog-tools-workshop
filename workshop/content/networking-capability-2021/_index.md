Welcome to the Service Catalog tools network capability workshop - 2021 edition. 

In this workshop you will be building out the networking capability for your landing zone.  You will learn how to 
provision resources into accounts, how to execute lambdas and how to provision resources using AWS Service Catalog, 
HashiCorp Terraform, AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation.  

The average completion time for the workshop is between 2 - 3 hours.

## What are we going to be doing?

You are going to use the Service Catalog Tools to set up an account as part of your multi account AWS implementation.
During this we will remove the default networking resources from your account and provision a new Amazon Virtual Private 
Cloud with subnets and security groups.  This is part of the networking capability for your foundation.
