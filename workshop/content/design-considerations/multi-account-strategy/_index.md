## What are we going to do?

This article will help you align your multi-account strategy with best practices.


## AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations helps you centrally govern your environment as you grow and scale your workloads on AWS. Whether you 
are a growing startup or a large enterprise, AWS Organizations helps you to centrally manage billing; control access, 
compliance, and security; and share resources across your AWS accounts.

Using AWS Organizations, you can automate account creation, create groups of accounts to reflect your business needs, 
and apply policies for these groups for governance. You can also simplify billing by setting up a single payment method
for all of your AWS accounts. Through integrations with other AWS services, you can use AWS Organizations to define central 
configurations and resource sharing across accounts in your organization. AWS Organizations is available to all AWS 
customers at no additional charge.
