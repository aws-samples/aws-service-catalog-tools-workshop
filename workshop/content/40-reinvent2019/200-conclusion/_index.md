## What have we accomplished? 


We started with a set of requirements for budget, cost, and data governance and turned them into codified controls in 
your AWS Accounts using native AWS Services and modern software development practices. 

 
- An AWS Config rule that helps us discover Amazon EC2 instance types in use
- An AWS Config rule that identifies Amazon RDS instances that do not use encryption at rest
- An AWS Service Catalog product that creates a curated version of Amazon Aurora that enforces encryption by default

In the workshop we used a single AWS Account and a single AWS Region to show you what's possible using open source 
service catalog tools and AWS Service Catalog. You can use the service catalog tools and AWS Service Catalog to 
provision products across AWS estates that have hundreds of AWS Accounts, in different regions based on your 
requirements. 

## What's next? 

We recommend that you follow this workshop with further reading about 
[service catalog factory](https://aws-service-catalog-factory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and 
[service catalog puppet](https://aws-service-catalog-puppet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get a deeper understanding of
how the service catalog tools work behind the scenes to easily create and provision curated AWS Service Catalog products
across your organisation. 

Level up your skills by trying out the tasks you've completed across an estate of AWS Accounts. Think about how you 
could fit the tools into your day-to-day workflow with AWS Service Catalog.
