## What are we going to do?

We are going to perform the following steps:

- define a product with a version and a portfolio 
- add the source code for the product
- provision that product into a spoke account

The "hub" AWS account is the source of truth for our AWS Service Catalog products. "Spoke" AWS accounts are consumers of these products.

## Step by step guide

Here are the steps you need to follow to "{{% param title %}}"

### Define a product with a version and a portfolio

- Navigate to the {{% service_catalog_factory_code_commit_repo_link %}}  

- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the *Create file* button

{{< figure src="/tasks/create_file.png" >}}

- Copy the following snippet into the main input field:

 {{% code file="40-reinvent2019/100-task-1/artefacts/factory/completed.yaml" language="js" %}}
 
- Set the *File name* to `portfolios/reinvent.yaml`

- Set your *Author name*
- Set your *Email address*
- Set your *Commit message*

- Click the *Commit changes* button:

#### What did we just do?

The YAML file we created in the CodeCommit repository told the framework to perform several actions:

- create a product named _{{% param product_name %}}_
- add a _{{% param product_version %}}_ of our product
- create a portfolio named _{{% param portfolio_name %}}_
- add the product: _{{% param product_name %}}_ to the portfolio: _{{% param portfolio_name %}}_

#### Verify the change worked

Once you have made your changes the {{% service_catalog_factory_pipeline_link %}} should have run. If you were very quick in making the change, the pipeline 
may still be running.  If it has not yet started feel free to the hit the *Release change* button.

Once it has completed it should show the *Source* and *Build* stages in green to indicate they have completed 
successfully:

### Add the source code for our product

When you configured your product version, you specified the following version: 

{{% code file="40-reinvent2019/100-task-1/artefacts/factory/create-the-version--version-only.yaml" language="js" %}}

This tells the framework the source code for the product comes from the _{{% param codecommit_repo_branch %}}_ branch of a
_CodeCommit_ repository of the name _{{% param codecommit_repo_name %}}_. 

We now need to create the CodeCommit repository and add the AWS CloudFormation template we are going to use for our
product.

- Navigate to {{% codecommit_link %}}

- Click *Create repository*

{{< figure src="/tasks/CreateRepository.png" >}}

- Input the name `{{% param codecommit_repo_name %}}`

{{< figure src="/tasks/InputTheName.png" >}}

- Click *Create*

{{< figure src="/tasks/ClickCreate.png" >}}

- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the *Create file* button

{{< figure src="/tasks/create_file.png" >}}

- Copy the following snippet into the main input field:

 {{% code 
    file="40-reinvent2019/100-task-1/artefacts/product.template.yaml" 
    language="js" 
 %}}

- Set the *File name* to `product.template.yaml`

- Set your *Author name*
- Set your *Email address*
- Set your *Commit message*

{{% notice tip %}}

{{% /notice %}}

Creating that file should trigger your 
{{% codepipeline_pipeline_link "aws-config-desired-instance-types-v1-pipeline" %}}.  

Once the pipeline has completed it should show the *Source*, *Package* and *Deploy* stages in green to indicate they have 
completed successfully:

{{< figure src="/tasks/SuccessfulFactoryProductRun.png" >}}

{{% notice tip %}}
You should see your commit message on this screen, it will help you know which version of ServiceCatalogFactory repository the 
pipeline is processing.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
If this is failing please raise your hand for some assistance
{{% /notice %}}

Once you have verified the pipeline has run you can go to {{% service_catalog_products_list_link %}} to view your newly
created version.

You should see the product you created listed:

{{< figure src="/tasks/SeeYourTask1Product.png" >}}

Click on the product and verify *{{% param product_version %}}* is there

{{< figure src="/tasks/SeeYourTask1ProductVersion1.png" >}}

{{% notice note %}}
If you cannot see your version please raise your hand for some assistance
{{% /notice %}}

You have now successfully created a version for your product! 

#### Verify the product was added to the portfolio


Now that you have verified the pipeline has run you can go to {{% service_catalog_portfolios_list_link %}} to view your
portfolio.

- Click on *reinvent-cloud-engineering-governance*

{{< figure src="/tasks/PortfolioReinventCloudEngineeringGovernance.png" >}}

- Click on the product *_{{% param product_name %}}_*

- Click on the version *_{{% param product_version %}}_*
