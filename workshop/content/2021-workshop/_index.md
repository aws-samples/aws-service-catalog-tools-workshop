Welcome to the Service Catalog tools network capability workshop - 2021 edition. 

The average completion time for the workshop is between 2 - 3 hours.


## What are we going to be doing?

In this workshop you will be building out the networking capability for your multi-account environment.  

You will learn about some of the essential building blocks the Service Catalog tools provide you when creating your 
multi account workflow:
- provisioning resources into accounts using AWS CloudFormation, AWS Service Catalog and Hashicorp Terraform
- executing AWS Lambda functions 
- Sharing Service Catalog portfolios

You will be using these building blocks to:

- Remove the default networking resources from your AWS accounts
- Provision a new AWS VPC using AWS CloudFormation
- Provision a new subnet using AWS Service Catalog
- Provision a new subnet using Hashicorp Terraform
- Share a Service Catalog portfolio so end users can create their own subnets
