## What are we going to do?

We need to install the Service Catalog tools to get started.  The Service Catalog tools comprises of two open source
solutions:

- aws-service-catalog-factory - this helps us build pipelines for a single account
- aws-service-catalog-puppet - this helps us to share, provision and configure resources across a multi account

For the workshop we recommend you install the tools in the same region as each other and we recommend you use eu-west-1.
