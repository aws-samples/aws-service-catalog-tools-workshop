Greetings, intrepid builders! You've made it.  Based on your impressive work so far, you have all been hired to work with the best and the brightest at ACME Corp (TODO). In your new roles as cloud engineers(TODO), you will deliver service catalog products that meet stringent security requirements with ease.

The following tasks will test your mettle as you make your way through dimly lit dungeons, defeat large reptilian creatures, and rescue royalty trapped in castles. Just kidding, you only have to write a little bit of YAML, and see how far you can get with very little code using tools that you  use in your day-to-day jobs.

This is  what've we've done so far:

* ✅ Installed service-catalog-factory that lets you build service catalog portfolios and products
* ✅ Installed service-catalog-puppet that lets you share service catalog products and provision them elsewhere.
* ✅ Made it this far without giving up.

We have three tasks set up for you, each of these tasks requires you to think about security requirements that have been set by ACME Corp (TODO) and build easy to use solutions. You will be provided with code and instructions on how to complete these tasks - but take your time to understand what is going on under the hood, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

The goal of these tasks is to get you familiar with using service catalog tools and understanding how you could build a workflow to build service catalog products with security and governance requirements in mind.

Don't worry if you cannot complete all the assigned tasks during the workshop, you can complete them in your own time, using your own AWS account.
