### Provisioning the product


_We will add our account to the frameworks manifest file so it knows about our account and we will tell the framework to
provision our newly created product into our account._


#### Adding an account to the manifest file

_We will start out by adding your account to the manifest file._

- Navigate to the {{% service_catalog_puppet_code_commit_repo_link %}}


- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the *Create file* button

{{< figure src="/tasks/create_file.png" >}}

- Copy the following snippet into the main input field:

 {{% code file="50-revinvent2019/200-task-2/artefacts/manifest-accounts.yaml" language="yaml" %}}
 
- Update account_id on line to show your account id


#### Adding the product to the manifest

_Now we are ready to add a product to the manifest file._

- Add the following snippet to the end of the main input field:

 {{% code file="50-revinvent2019/200-task-2/artefacts/manifest-launches.yaml" language="yaml" %}}


- The main input field should look like this:

 {{% code file="50-revinvent2019/200-task-2/artefacts/manifest-all.yaml" language="yaml" %}}


#### Committing the manifest file

_Now that we have written the manifest file we are ready to commit it._

- Set the *File name* to `manifest.yaml`

- Set your *Author name*
- Set your *Email address*
- Set your *Commit message*

#### Verifying the provisioning


Once you have made your changes the {{% service_catalog_puppet_pipeline_link %}} should have run or if you were quick 
may still be running.  If it has not yet started feel free to the hit the *Release change* button.

Once it has completed it should show the *Source* and *Build* stages in green to indicate they have completed 
successfully:

the filter by drop down in the top right:
