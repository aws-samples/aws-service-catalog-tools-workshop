## The ask



## The plan
_We are going to create an AWS Service Catalog product and provision it into our account.  This product will enable an 
AWS Config managed rule that will check if server side encryption is enabled on the AWS S3 buckets in our account._

_To do this we will need to use Service Catalog factory to build the product and then we will need to use Service Catalog
puppet to provision it into the designated account._
